    </summary>
    <p class="motivation-text">
        I perceive Development as an interesting constructor, in which, using well-mastered elements and tools, you can construct something new, your own and working. Also, sometimes this is became like a puzzle for me, in which the enjoy of the solution compensates for all the effort invested.
    </p>
    <p class="motivation-text">
        I adhere to the idea that the Internet and modern, still young technologies can make our world better and more wealthy. And in general I look at Development as a good opportunity to contribute to this process.
